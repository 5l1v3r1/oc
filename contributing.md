Contributing guidelines
=======================

Contributes are more than welcome! 

### Troubleshooting

If you find an issue, feel free to check the [issues](https://github.com/opentable/oc/issues) page, and open a new one if you need.

### Sending a Pull Request

If you want to send a Pull Request, ensure you join the conversation first on the [issues page](https://github.com/opentable/oc/issues)! This is to avoid multiple people working on the same thing. You can get in touch via the [chat](https://gitter.im/opentable/oc) too.

When preparing a pull request, ensure all the tests pass locally running `grunt test-local`. If you have admin rights, open a new branch on the upstream opentable repo.
